## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in backend development, with a unique foundation in Analytical Chemistry that sharpens my approach to solving complex technical problems. I build scalable, production-ready systems with clean, maintainable code—whether architecting robust APIs or deploying full-stack applications.

Over the past 2.5 years, I've designed and shipped production projects both independently (**SkillSwap**, **AnyWork**) and collaboratively with cross-functional teams (**HMS hotel management software**), handling everything from database design and API architecture to Docker deployments on AWS.

I thrive in collaborative, remote environments where problem-solving happens through thoughtful discussion and hands-on building. Whether leading a feature independently or contributing to team goals, I focus on clear communication, thorough documentation, and shipping quality software.

**Currently seeking:** Backend or full-stack engineering roles where I can grow into senior-level responsibilities and contribute to scalable, impactful systems.
